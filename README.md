Follow the instructions in this readme if you want to take part in larger open source projects.

# What this is.

I'm forming a team of software development engineers who want to work on larger open source projects and contribute to them in meaningful ways while at the same time, getting expert guidance and mentorship from seasoned industry professionals with over 25 years of professional experience.

This will allow the more junior members (people with less than 25 years of professional experience) to learn from the people who have it, While actively contributing to open source projects Designed to have an impact not just on the world, but to be meaningful for the resumes of the people who work on them.

# To Register

Submit PR to add yourself to the team in question that starts with "[Interested]", listing:

## Skills that you can currently bring to the table.

For example, if you know a programming language such as C#, Python, or Rust and it's your core language on most projects make sure you list that as a skill you can currently bring to the table.

This doesn't need to be programming. It can also be art or sound or whatever.

## Skills you're willing to deep dive into as a total noob, but use your own time to ramp up on.

For example, if you want to work on a future project in a language you don't currently know, but you're willing to learn that language to work on it, say so.

# To Deregister

Submit another PR to remove yourself.

# Process Goals

## Registering

We want to make registration of intent as simple and easy as possible and provide automation to make that simpler.

But we also want to make sure there's quality control, because we're fully aware that trolls will try to do bad things.

## De-registering

The current goal is to write automation to automatically accept when somebody attempts to deregister themselves.

# Living document

This is a living document that will update and change based on the process that currently exists.  As it changes, so will this document.
