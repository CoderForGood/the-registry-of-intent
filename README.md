Follow the instructions in this readme if you want to take part in larger open source projects.

# What this is.

I'm forming a team of software development engineers who want to work on larger open source projects and contribute to them in meaningful ways while at the same time, getting expert guidance and mentorship from seasoned industry professionals with over 10-25+ years of professional experience.

This will allow the more junior members (people with less than 10-25+ years of professional experience) to learn from the people who have it, While actively contributing to open source projects Designed to have an impact not just on the world, but to be meaningful for the resumes of the people who work on them.

# To Register

Submit a issue and follow the 'interested' template.

# To Explicitly Deregister (Leave)

Submit an issue and follow the 'leaving' template If you want to explicitly leave projects. It's okay. We understand that not everybody has time for open source, but letting us know instead of simply ghosting is the professional and right thing to do.

# Process Goals

## Registering

We want to make registration of intent as simple and easy as possible and provide automation to make that simpler. As a result, issue templates are provided to make things easier on everybody. Please, fill them out fully if you can.

But we also want to make sure there's quality control, because we're fully aware that trolls will try to do bad things. As a result, not everybody that requests to be added to the team will be added.

We expect you to act professional on the team. This is something that we hope will be good for people's resumes, So we're running it with that in mind.
